# Exercism Java Exercises Repository

Welcome to my **Exercism Java Exercises Repository**! This repository serves as a personal record of my journey through the Java track on [Exercism](https://exercism.org), where I am actively improving my skills in object-oriented programming, problem-solving, and clean code practices.

## About This Repository

This repository is structured to showcase the solutions I've developed as I progress through the exercises on Exercism. Each exercise is carefully implemented and documented to reflect my understanding and application of key programming concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- **Polymorphism and Inheritance**  
- **Exception Handling**  
- **Generics and Type Safety**  
- **Functional Programming in Java**  

I regularly update this repository as I complete new exercises, ensuring it remains an up-to-date reflection of my learning journey.

## Why This Repository?

By sharing my progress publicly, I aim to:  
1. **Document my learning process** for personal and professional growth.  
2. **Demonstrate my coding abilities** to potential employers and collaborators.  
3. **Contribute to the open-source community** by sharing solutions that may help others on their learning journey.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Each folder under `src/` corresponds to an individual exercise, containing:  
- **Solution.java**: My implementation of the exercise.  
- **Tests.java**: Unit tests (where applicable).  
- **README.md**: The exercise description provided by Exercism.

## Highlights

- All code is written with readability and maintainability in mind, adhering to clean code principles.  
- Whenever applicable, solutions are optimized for performance and scalability.  
- Constructive feedback from the Exercism community is incorporated into the solutions.

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE**  
- **JUnit** (for testing where necessary)  
- **Git** (for version control)
